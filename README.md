# Angular2 Components Library Seed

This repository represents a seed project for developing AngularJS 2 
components. 

## Building Steps

``` 
    git clone https://github.com/cstefanache/ng2-components.git
    cd ng2-components
    npm install
    npm run all
```

After executing all task from the build script the browser window will open displaying the message 'Hello World'.
The typescript transpiler is executed in watch mode so any change saved on both component and test application will
apply immediately and will refresh the browser page.
When creating a new component make sure that you update *components.ts* file to export it for the test application.
